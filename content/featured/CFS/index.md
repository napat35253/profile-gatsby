My primary responsibilities in the development of the autonomous racing car include designing the software architecture, managing the data logger, and constructing an in-house simulator from the ground up. This simulator is tailored for modeling autonomous tests and has been engineered to support various computer architectures, enabling versatile and comprehensive testing environments for our autonomous racing efforts.
