Following my recognition with the Toyota award, I received funding to bring my autonomous driving concept to life by adapting a real vehicle. I undertook the project of remodeling a TOYOTA Ha:mo car, modifying its brake and steering systems to enable autonomous functionality. My role involved designing a high-level system for path planning and decision-making, utilizing Lidar and GNSS as the primary sensors.
